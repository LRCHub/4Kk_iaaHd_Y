I can't breathe in with hands on my neck
I scream but the grip, it holds on
No reason
I'm trapped in my head
Defeated

I've never felt this
The voice in my face screams violence
The grip it holds on
No reason
I'm trapped in my head
Defeated

I've never felt so close to giving up on hope
Should I hide it
Should I fight it
Should I roll over and die
You never know
You never know until you know know know
You never know until you know know know
You never know until you know know know

I can't breathe in with hands on my neck
I scream but the grip, it holds on
No reason
I'm trapped in my head
Defeated

I've never felt so close to giving up on hope
Should I hide it
Should I fight it
Should I roll over and die
You never know
You never know until you know know know

I've never felt this
The voice in my face screams violence
The grip it holds on
No reason
I'm trapped in my head
Defeated

You never know until you know

I've never felt so close to giving up on hope
Should I hide it
Should I fight it
Should I roll over and die
You never know
You never know until you know know know
You never know until you know know know
You never know until you know know know
