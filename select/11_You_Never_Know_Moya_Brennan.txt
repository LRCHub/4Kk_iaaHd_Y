We lost away along winding waters
The distance now already so far away
Everyday I watched the seasons changing
Reminds me of memories, times that are gone

You never know
If we'll laugh or cry, what we'll need again
You never know
If we'll say goodbye, what we'll need again
You never know
If the time is right, what we'll need again
You never know
If the story ends, what we'll need again

Too young to know
The innocence that's around it us
We watched the stars that night
They sparkled with moon
Thoughts about tomorrow
Days, rains will keep falling
Will we ever know the answers
All will be dream

You never know
If we'll laugh or cry, what we'll need again
You never know
If we'll say goodbye, what we'll need again
You never know
If the time is right, what we'll need again
You never know
If the story ends, what we'll need again

I never know
I never know
I never know
I never know
