I'm laying naked with ya
After making love
I caught a cold
I barely made it home
You said you loved me only
I felt no pain
And then I crashed my rent-a-car in the pouring rain

Seen it on a billboard
And I believe it's so
It said, "The only thing you know for certain
Is 'Hey, you never know'"
My friend Jerry's feet are achin'
Says he's hittin' bottom
Says it's a sex problem
He told me so

I told him
"Jerry ain't the lovin' that you're makin' buddy
It's layin' out all night
And lookin' for it that makes you slow
Want some advice
And it's free for a reason you know
They say you only live twice
I said, "Hey, you never know" And the hula girls go...(ahhh)
You never, I said you never, never,
You Never Know

I'll make suggestions honey
You make the choices
Your Kodak moment's comin'
I'll keep the motor runnin'
I stand corrected baby
I'm hearin' voices honey
You got my engines hummin'
And now I'm really runnin'
Right up your driveway
Playin' hide in your hole
I'm on cruise control

And if they're sayin' that we're crazy
Well, Hey, You Never Know
There go them hula girls again...(ahhh)
You never, I said you never, never
You Never Know
